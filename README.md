Better dementia diagnosis through data

Here we have trained a Random Forest algorithm to distinguish between dementia patients having Alzeimehr’s Disease (AD) versus behavioral variant Frontotemporal (bvFTD) based on data we obtained from the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC). The model has an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.83
